## Question: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

### Most interesting idea  

What stuck out to me was the emphasis on starting extremely small — 
doing a tiny action so easy that skipping it feels harder than doing it. 
This “tiny is mighty” approach makes habit-building almost effortless and sustainable.

## Question: How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A and P?

### What are M, A and P  
- **M = Motivation** — how much you want to do the behavior.  
- **A = Ability** — how easy the behavior is to do.  
- **P = Prompt** — the reminder or trigger that tells you to do the behavior.

### How B = MAP makes habits easier  
- Choose a **very tiny habit** so Ability is high (easy to do).  
- Add a clear **Prompt** — attach the habit to an existing routine (e.g., after brushing teeth).  
- Don’t depend only on Motivation; use high Ability + a strong Prompt to stay consistent even when motivation drops.  
- If a habit still feels difficult, make it even simpler to raise Ability.

## Question: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

### Answer  
- Celebrating immediately creates a **positive emotion** in your brain.  
- That emotion signals your brain to **remember and repeat** the behavior.  
- Celebration builds confidence and makes the habit feel rewarding.  
- The stronger the positive feeling, the faster the new habit becomes automatic.

## 1% Better Every Day Video Question: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

### What Stood Out to Me  

The most interesting idea was that improving by just **1% every single day** — small, consistent gains — can compound over time into big success.  
The video shows that little improvements done daily add up (like a compounding effect), making long‑term progress much more achievable than trying big changes at once.

## Book Summary of Atomic Habits

## Question 5: What is the book’s perspective about Identity?

- The book says the goal is not just to achieve something, but to *become* the type of person who does that.  
- Every time you do a habit, you cast a “vote” for the identity you want (e.g. doing reading = you are a reader, exercising = you are a fit person).  
- Over time, repeated habits shape and reinforce your identity.  

## Question 6: How to make a habit easier to do (according to the book)

- Make the habit obvious — arrange your environment so the cue is visible.  
- Make the habit attractive — link it with something you enjoy or frame it positively.  
- Make the habit easy — simplify it so it requires minimal effort (e.g. start very small).  
- Make the habit satisfying — include a small reward or feedback so it feels good to complete.  

## Question 7: How to make a habit harder to do (according to the book)

- Make the bad habit invisible — remove triggers or cues that prompt it.  
- Make it unattractive — reframe the habit to highlight negative consequences.  
- Make it difficult — add friction or extra steps so it's harder to do.  
- Make it unsatisfying — remove rewards or attach negative consequences to discourage it.

# Reflection

## Question 8: Pick one habit you would like to do more of and steps to make it easier, attractive, or satisfying

### Habit: Daily Reading  

- **Cue obvious:** Keep the book on the desk or nightstand where it’s visible.  
- **Habit attractive:** Pair reading with a favorite tea or coffee.  
- **Habit easy:** Start with 5–10 minutes per day instead of long sessions.  
- **Response satisfying:** Track reading streaks or reward yourself after completing a chapter.  

## Question 9: Pick one habit you would like to eliminate or do less of and steps to make it harder or unsatisfying

### Habit: Mindless Social Media Scrolling  

- **Cue invisible:** Remove social media apps from the home screen.  
- **Process unattractive:** Turn off notifications and log out after each use.  
- **Process hard:** Set a password barrier or time limits.  
- **Response unsatisfying:** Track screen time to show wasted hours, creating awareness of negative impact.
