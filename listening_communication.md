### What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)

- Be fully present — give complete attention; avoid distractions.
- Use positive body language — eye contact, nodding, open posture.
- Don’t interrupt — let the speaker finish before you respond.
- Paraphrase/reflect — repeat the main idea in your own words to confirm understanding.
- Ask clarifying questions — use simple, open-ended questions to understand better.
- Show empathy — acknowledge their feelings and emotions.
- Summarize at the end — briefly recap what you understood before responding.


### According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)

- Give full attention — focus completely on the speaker and remove distractions.
- Understand their point of view — try to see the situation from their perspective without judging.
- Recognize feelings and emotions — notice their tone, mood, and body language, not just their words.
- Reflect their message back — repeat or summarise what they said in similar words to show you understood.
- Stay on their topic — respond only to what they are talking about; don’t shift the conversation.
- Use silence when needed — allow pauses so the speaker can think and continue.

### Obstacles in Your Listening Process

- Getting distracted easily
- Thinking about your reply instead of listening
- Judging the speaker too quickly
- Interrupting or finishing their sentences
- Noise or multitasking
- Emotional reactions that block understanding

### What You Can Do to Improve Listening

- Stay fully present and avoid distractions
- Let the speaker finish before responding
- Ask clarifying questions
- Take notes to remember details
- Paraphrase what you heard to confirm understanding
- Practise empathy and focus on their feelings as well as words

### When I switch to Passive communication

- When I feel it’s too much effort to argue or express my opinion.
- When I fear conflict or want to avoid hurting someone’s feelings.
- When I’m uncertain or lack confidence about what I want.
- When I don’t want to “rock the boat,” so I stay quiet and go along with others.

### When I switch to Aggressive communication

- When I feel frustrated or angry and want to force my point across.
- When I think the other person is ignoring me or being unfair.
- When I want immediate results and don’t care about others’ feelings.
- When I feel threatened — emotionally, professionally, or personally — and respond with dominance.

### When I switch to Passive-Aggressive communication

- When I’m upset but don’t want to confront directly — so I respond indirectly (sarcasm, coldness, silent treatment).
- When I feel powerless or believe direct communication won’t help.
- When I want to express irritation without openly fighting.
- When I hold resentment inside but show “okay” outwardly, leading to hidden negativity.

### How to make my communication Assertive (improvements I can apply)

- Think before I speak — choose words calmly, don’t react impulsively.
- Use “I”-statements to express my feelings/opinions (e.g. “I feel …”, “I think …”) — avoids blaming others.
- Be honest and direct about what I want/need, while respecting other person’s feelings.
- Maintain calm tone and respectful body language — good posture, eye contact, calm voice.
- Listen actively when others speak; try to understand their view before responding.
- Be open to compromise — stand up for myself without dominating or ignoring others.
