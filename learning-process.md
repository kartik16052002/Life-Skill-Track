### 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
  The concept of focus mode and diffuse mode was the most interesting part for me. 

### What are active and diffused modes of thinking? 
  - Focused (active) mode — when you concentrate intently on a problem or topic, using logic, 
    step-by-step thinking and familiar neural paths. 
  - Diffuse mode — when your mind relaxes and wanders (for example during breaks, walking, showering),
    allowing different brain regions to connect ideas in new ways and leading to insight and creativity.

### 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

  - Deconstruct the skill (break it into smaller parts) 
  - Learn enough to self-correct (use a few resources to know when you make mistakes) 
  - Remove practice barriers (eliminate distractions, make practice easy and accessible) 
  - Practice for at least 20 hours (commit to focused practice until the “frustration barrier” is crossed)

### 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
  
  - Break topics into small parts
  - Explain concepts in simple words (Feynman style)
  - Switch between focused and relaxed (diffuse) thinking
  - Remove distractions while studying
  - Do short, consistent practice sessions
